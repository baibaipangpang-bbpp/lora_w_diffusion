## Future work idea: 
The limitation of max_length imposed by CLIP is 77. This is a significant limitation for the task on hand, as the caligraphy is usually a piece of text, I was hoping to get the model to understand the 1:1 mapping of the words.  Encorporating T5/BERT model to text embedding could be explored to eleviate the limitations. 



## Things to do
- [ ] Wandb integration 
- [ ] Add lora to conv layer and compare performances 
- [ ] Visualize attention layer
- [ ] Visualize conv layer 
- [ ] Adapative lora based on the weights. 
- [ ] 赵孟頫 add data set
- [ ] 褚遂良 add data set
- [ ] 颜真卿 data set to
- [ ] experiment to see whether we can mix the style.
- [ ] Add “书法” to all text. 

## eval!!!!
